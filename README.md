A little library I'm working on that provides a sane endpoint for you to consume Brighton & Hove Bus Company's stop and timetable data.

The motivation behind the project is that Google Maps is basically too inaccurate when it comes to times, and using it to check times for a particular stop can be clunky. Better to get the data from the horse's mouth.

The end goal is to have a web app that's basically just a replication of the digital timetables they have as bus stops anyway, except you know, accessible from anywhere. Also maybe a version I can run from the command line, because why not?
